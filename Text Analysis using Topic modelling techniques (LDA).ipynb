    "CONCLUSION:\n",
    "\n",
    "In this Project we have used the Reviews data set.The data set contains user reviews for different products in the food category.\n",
    "\n",
    "We used LDA to group the user reviews into 5 categories.In the script above we used the CountVectorizer class to create a document-term matrix.It is used to transform a given text into a vector on the basis of the frequency (count) of each word that occurs in the entire text.\n",
    "We tuned it such that only to include those words that appear in less than 80% of the document and appear in at least 2 documents. We also remove all the stop words as they do not really contribute to topic modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "The output which prints the top ten words of a topic shows that the second topic might contain reviews about chocolates, etc.Similarly, the third topic might again contain reviews about sodas or juices.\n",
    "You can see that there a few common words in all the categories. This is because there are few words that are used for almost all the topics. For instance \"good\", \"great\", \"like\" etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, We have added another column in the dataset which tells us which Topic the review most probably belongs to.Hence we have classified the reviews based on Text analysis using LDA.\n"
